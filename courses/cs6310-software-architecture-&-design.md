## P1L1 Introduction

- **Objectives**
    - Express the **analysis and design**  of an application using the [**Unified Modeling Notation (UML)**]().
    - Specify **functional semantics** od an application using the [**Object Constraint Language (OCL)**]().
    - Specify and evaluate **software architectural styles**
    - Select and use appropriate **architectural styles**
    - Understand and apply **object-oriented design** techniques
    - Select and use appropriate **software design patterns**
    - Understand and participate in a **design review**

## P1L2 Text Browser Exercise

- Define **GUI elements** (based on Swing or SWT): FileNamger, ViewPort, and ScrollBar.
- Constract the **Analysis Model** with UML class-model diagram (rectangles for classes/components).
    - Each rectangle is divited vertically(from top to buttom): ClassNmame, Attributes(percepts), Operations.
- Add **Relationships** between the components: Associations, Aggregations, Generalization.
- Think about **Subtleties** which include special cases and uniques situations...

## P1L3 Design Concepts

    "Design is EVERYWHERE: from Internatinal Space Station to Dinner Parties" - Prof. Spencer Rugaber

- **Design** is a deliberative, purposive planning.
- **Engineering** is a skilful or artful contrivance applying scientific and mathematical principles
- **Software Design** is a process of building a program while satisfying a problem's functional requirements and not violating its non-functional constraints. Contains two phases.
    - **Architectural design** is a process of identifying and assigning the responsibility for aspects of behavior to varios modules or components of a software.
    - **Detail deisgn** is a process of specifying the behavior of each of the system components that you're identified during architectural design. 
        - **Psedo code; Program Design Language (PDL)** (keywords, data delcaration, syntax).
        - **Structure programming** (sequence, condidtion, repetitions).
        - **Flowcharts; call graphs** (directed graphs, computational units).
        - **Desicion tables** (rules, conditions, actions).

**Approaches** to Software Design. It's include 3 aspects: method, representational, and validation.

**Design Documentation** is key concept in Software Design.
